## PostgreSQL in-place major upgrade

This role is designed for in-place major upgrades of PostgreSQL (e.g., from version 15 to 16).

#### Compatibility

The upgrade is supported starting from PostgreSQL 9.3 and up to the latest PostgreSQL version.

#### Requirements

There is no need to plan additional disk space, because when upgrading PostgreSQL using hard links instead of copying files. However, it is required that the `pg_old_datadir` and `pg_new_datadir` are located within the same top-level directory (`pg_upper_datadir` variable).

Specify the current (old) version of PostgreSQL in the `pg_old_version` variable and target version of PostgreSQL for the upgrade in the `pg_new_version` variable.

#### Recommendations

1. Before upgrading to a new major version, it's recommended to update PostgreSQL and its extensions. Additionally, consider updating Patroni and the entire system.

    To achieve this, use the `update_pgcluster.yml` playbook. More details can be found [here](../update/README.md).

2. Before moving forward, execute preliminary checks to ensure that your database schema is compatible with the upcoming PostgreSQL version and that the cluster is ready for the upgrade.
   
    To do this, run the `pg_upgrade.yml` playbook using the tags '`pre-checks,upgrade-check`'.

    If any errors arise, such as schema object incompatibilities, resolve these issues and repeat the checks.
    
    Once the playbook completes the pre-checks without any errors, you should see the following messages in the Ansible log: 
    - "`The database schema is compatible with PostgreSQL <new_version>`"
    - "`Clusters are compatible`"

    Upon seeing these messages, proceed to run the playbook without any tags to initiate the upgrade.

### Upgrade

```bash
ansible-playbook pg_upgrade.yml -e "pg_old_version=14 pg_new_version=15"
```

#### Database Downtime Considerations

To minimize or even eliminate errors during database upgrades (depending on the workload and timeouts), we pause the PgBouncer pools. From an application's perspective, this does not result in terminated database connections. Instead, applications might experience a temporary increase in query latency while the PgBouncer pools are paused.

On average, the PgBouncer pause duration is approximately 30 seconds. However, for larger databases, this pause might be extended due to longer `pg_upgrade` and `rsync` procedures. The default maximum wait time for a request during a pause is set to 2 minutes (controlled by the `query_wait_timeout` pgbouncer parameter). If the pause exceeds this duration, connections will be terminated with a timeout error.

### Rollback

This playbook performs a rollback of a PostgreSQL upgrade.

```bash
ansible-playbook pg_upgrade_rollback.yml
```

It's designed to be used when a PostgreSQL upgrade hasn't been fully completed and the new version hasn't been started.
The rollback operation is performed by starting the Patroni cluster with the old version of PostgreSQL using the same PGDATA.
The playbook first checks the health of the current cluster, verifies the version of PostgreSQL, and ensures the new PostgreSQL is not running.
If these checks pass, the playbook switches back to the old PostgreSQL paths and restarts the Patroni service.
