# PostgreSQL Cluster Console API service

Server-side component for PostgreSQL Cluster Console. This REST service implements the API for UI integration.

The project is written in `Go` and uses [Swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) for server-side code generation. The server receives requests from the web to create and manage clusters. Under the hood, the server uses Docker to run `postgresql_cluster` image with Ansible playbooks for cluster deployment logic.

## Build
Swagger specification is used for creating the server REST API. First, you need to install the Swagger tool to build the auto-generated Go files.
```
export dir=$$(mktemp -d)
git clone https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger "$$dir"
cd "$$dir"
go install ./cmd/swagger
```
Then, you need to generate the server-side files:
```
swagger generate server --name DbConsole --spec api/swagger.yaml --principal interface{} --exclude-main
```

After that, you can build the server with the following command:
```
go build -o pg-console main.go
```

The project also contains a Makefile with all commands, so you can simply run the following steps:
```
make swagger_install
make swagger
make build
```

## Configuration
Server is configured via the environment. The following environment variables can be used:
```
