## Update the PostgreSQL HA Cluster

This role is designed to update the PostgreSQL HA cluster to a new minor version (for example, 15.1->15.2, and etc).

By default, only PostgreSQL packages defined in the postgresql_packages variable are updated (vars/Debian.yml or vars/RedHat.yml). In addition, you can update Patroni or the entire system. 

#### Usage

Update PostgreSQL:

`ansible-playbook update_pgcluster.yml`

Update Patroni:

`ansible-playbook update_pgcluster.yml -e target=patroni`

Update all system packages:

`ansible-playbook update_pgcluster.yml -e target=system`


#### Variables

- `target` 
  - Defines the target for the update.
  - Available values: 'postgres', 'patroni', 'system'
  - Default value: `postgres`
- `max_replication_lag_bytes`
  - Determines the size of the replication lag above which the update will not be performed.
  - Note: If the lag is high, you will be prompted to try again later.
  - Default value: `10485760` (10 MiB)
- `max_transaction_sec`
  - Determines the maximum transaction time, in the presence of which the update will not be performed.
  - Note: If long-running transactions are present, you will be prompted to try again later. 
  - Default value: `15` (seconds)
- `update_extensions`
  - Attempt to automatically update all PostgreSQL extensions in all databases.
  - Note: Specify 'false', to avoid updating extensions.
  - Default value: `true`
- `reboot_host_after_update`
  - Restart the server if it is required after the update.
  - Default value: `true`
- `reboot_host_timeout`
  - Maximum seconds to wait for machine to reboot and respond to a test command.
  - Default value: `1800` (30 minutes)
- `reboot_host_post_delay`
  - The waiting time (in minutes) for the caches to warm up after restarting the server before updating the next server.
  - Note: Applicable when there are multiple replicas.
  - Default value: `5` (minutes).

## Plan:

Note: About the expected downtime of the database during the update:

When using load balancing for read-only traffic (the "Type A" and "Type C" schemes), zero downtime is expected (for read traffic), provided there is more than one replica in the cluster. For write traffic (to the Primary), the expected downtime is ~5-10 seconds.

#### 1. PRE-UPDATE: Perform pre-update tasks
- Test PostgreSQL DB Access
- Make sure that physical replication is active
  - Stop, if there are no active replicas
- Make sure there is no high replication lag
  - Note: no more than `max_replication_lag_bytes`
  - Stop, if replication lag is high
- Make sure there are no long-running transactions
  - no more than `max_transaction_sec`
  - Stop, if long-running transactions detected
- Update the pgBackRest package on the backup server (Dedicated Repository Host).
  - Note: This task runs only if the backup host is specified in the 'pgbackrest' group in the inventory file, and the variable `target` is set to '`system`'.
#### 2. UPDATE: Secondary (one by one)
- Stop read-only traffic
  - Enable `noloadbalance`, `nosync`, `nofailover` parameters in the patroni.yml
  - Reload patroni service
  - Make sure replica endpoint is unavailable
  - Wait for active transactions to complete
- Stop Services
  - Execute CHECKPOINT before stopping PostgreSQL
  - Stop Patroni service on the Cluster Replica
- Update PostgreSQL
  - if `target` variable is not defined or `target=postgres`
  - Install the latest version of PostgreSQL packages
- Update Patroni
  - if `target=patroni` (or `system`)
  - Install the latest version of Patroni package
- Update all system packages (includes PostgreSQL and Patroni)
  - if `target=system`
  - Update all system packages
- Start Services
  - Start Patroni service
  - Wait for Patroni port to become open on the host
  - Check that the Patroni is healthy
  - Check PostgreSQL is started and accepting connections
- Start read-only traffic
  - Disable `noloadbalance`, `nosync`, `nofailover` parameters in the patroni.yml
  - Reload patroni service
  - Make sure replica endpoint is available
  - Wait N minutes for caches to warm up after reboot
    - Note: variable `reboot_host_post_delay`
- Perform the same steps for the next replica server.
#### 3. UPDATE: Primary
- Switchover Patroni leader role
  - Perform switchover of the leader for the Patroni cluster
  -  Make sure that the Patroni is healthy and is a replica
     - Notes:
       - At this stage, the leader becomes a replica
       - the database downtime is ~5 seconds (write traffic)
- Stop read-only traffic
  - Enable `noloadbalance`, `nosync`, `nofailover` parameters in the patroni.yml
  - Reload patroni service
  - Make sure replica endpoint is unavailable
  - Wait for active transactions to complete
- Stop Services
  - Execute CHECKPOINT before stopping PostgreSQL
  - Stop Patroni service on the old Cluster Leader
- Update PostgreSQL
  - if `target` variable is not defined or `target=postgres`
  - Install the latest version of PostgreSQL packages
- Update Patroni
  - if `target=patroni` (or `system`)
  - Install the latest version of Patroni package
- Update all system packages (includes PostgreSQL and Patroni)
  - if `target=system`
  - Update all system packages
- Start Services
  - Start Patroni service
  - Wait for Patroni port to become open on the host
  - Check that the Patroni is healthy
  - Check PostgreSQL is started and accepting connections
- Start read-only traffic
  - Disable `noloadbalance`, `nosync`, `nofailover` parameters in the patroni.yml
  - Reload patroni service
  - Make sure replica endpoint is available
#### 4. POST-UPDATE: Update extensions
- Update extensions
  - Get the current Patroni Cluster Leader Node
  - Get a list of databases
  - Update extensions in each database
    - Get a list of old PostgreSQL extensions
    - Update old PostgreSQL extensions (if an update is required)
- Check the Patroni cluster state
- Check the current PostgreSQL version
- List the Patroni cluster members
- Update completed.
